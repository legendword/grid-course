# GridCourse

A tool for generating course timetables.

Access the tool here: https://legendword.com/grid-course

GridCourse provides you with a new, intuitive way to plan your courses! Simply put in what courses you want to take and view all lecture sections at the same time. The table generated helps you clearly see which sections are conflicting, what terms / days you can take a certain class, and how you want to spread your workload for each term!

Supports UBC Courses of the following academic sessions:

- 2022 Winter
- 2022 Summer

**Upcoming Features:**

- Click to choose a section for each course; automatically locks conflicting sections; when finished generates the timetable for you.
- Mark specific sections with tags such as "Good Prof" to better guide your choices.
